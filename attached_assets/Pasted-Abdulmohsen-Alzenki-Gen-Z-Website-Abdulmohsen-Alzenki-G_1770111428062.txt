You're just a few steps away from setting up your project
Let's get you ready to use Sanity with your preferred front end framework.
The Sanity Studio can only interact with documents in a dataset for which it has schema types registered in its configuration. It currently has none.

1
Create a new document type
Create a new file in your Studio’s schemaTypes folder called postType.ts with the code below which contains a set of fields for a new post document type.
/studio-gen-z-website/schemaTypes/postType.ts
import {defineField, defineType} from 'sanity'

export const postType = defineType({
  name: 'post',
  title: 'Post',
  type: 'document',
  fields: [
    defineField({
      name: 'title',
      type: 'string',
      validation: (rule) => rule.required(),
    }),
    defineField({
      name: 'slug',
      type: 'slug',
      options: {source: 'title'},
      validation: (rule) => rule.required(),
    }),
    defineField({
      name: 'publishedAt',
      type: 'datetime',
      initialValue: () => new Date().toISOString(),
      validation: (rule) => rule.required(),
    }),
    defineField({
      name: 'image',
      type: 'image',
    }),
    defineField({
      name: 'body',
      type: 'array',
      of: [{type: 'block'}],
    }),
  ],
})
2
Register the post schema type to the Studio schema
Now you can import this document type into the schemaTypes array in the index.ts file in the same folder.
/studio-gen-z-website/schemaTypes/index.ts
import {postType} from './postType'

export const schemaTypes = [postType]
3
Publish your first document
When you save these two files, your Studio should automatically reload and show your first document type. Click the + symbol at the top left to create and publish a new post document.
