Through this partnership, we are extending the opportunity to 2,000 Zainers to participate in an inclusive online Digital Transformation program, which also offers the possibility of attaining a Master's degree. This program has been designed to provide an immersive, interactive, and engaging learning experience that aligns with the demands of the contemporary digital landscape. It will serve as a route for Zain professionals to enhance their skills and evolve into the innovators and leaders in digital transformation that their departments require. Their goal is not merely to address the existing challenges but to excel in the face of both the known and unforeseen obstacles in our present and future business environments.

#### Introduction

![01-01.png](https://d27ne1peune2h7.cloudfront.net/media/images/01-01.original.webp)

WE, Zain’s Women Empowerment initiative, was created in 2017 under the vision of our Vice Chairman and Group CEO Bader AlKharafi. Initially launched under the name of Women Empowerment, it was later modified to a more inclusive name: WE. With women making up 14.5% of Zain’s leadership pool, WE established a target to be achieved by the end 2030: increase women leadership to 30%. With the support of our agents of change, our WE Champions, WE has launched many initiatives that support the fostering of a more diverse and inclusive Zain. Whether it is culture transformation, the introduction of inclusive policies, leadership development programs; and sponsoring women to attend the prestigious ESADE Business School to complete their MBAs; WE’s main focus is to create an environment that is empowering for all and that is equally inclusive and diverse to both women and men.

**Best Workplace for Women – 2024**

Zain Group has been honored in the Fast Company Middle East’s Best Workplaces for Women 2024 list as the winner of the large Enterprise category; an acknowledgement that signifies more than just an award as it validates Zain’s unwavering commitment to DEI into all aspects of the business.

The inaugural edition of Best Workplaces for Women recognizes companies across the Middle East that are empowering women by creating an inclusive environment, and the presence of Zain Group on the list, among other reputable companies, is an affirmation of the company’s corporate leadership in this area.

**Outstanding Sector Leadership and Growth - 2023**

Zain Group’s ground-breaking efforts in DEI within the company were recognized with a prestigious award at the prestigious SAMENA Council endorsed MEA Business Magazine Technology Achievement Awards 2023! This award for “Outstanding Sector Leadership and Growth” recognizes Zain’s DEI commitment to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace and the broader industry, a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team to create a diverse, inclusive and equitable environment for all.

The awards presentation took place during GITEX Global 2023 in Dubai by leading regional business publication MEA Business in coordination with SAMENA Council, were part of a multi-sector recognition awards program aimed at highlighting significant technology achievements in the ICT industry.

**Women Empowerment - 2023**

Zain was presented with the Championship Award in Women Empowerment 2023 at the annual Global Good Governance Awards recently held in Dubai and organized by Cambridge IFA, a UK-based think tank. The Award celebrates individuals, governments, public and private sector institutions, and NGOs that exhibit governance and sustainability as their strategic priority.

The recognition of these prestigious awards is testament not only to how much Zain believes in its purpose, but how relentless the company is in driving systemic change and providing meaningful connectivity to the communities it serves. Zain is among the most engaged organizations across the globe with respect to ensuring its operations are a positive, inclusive force for good, with a commitment to continuing to instill these principles at the heart of the organization.

**Best Women Development & Leadership Program – 2022**

Zain has been recognized as having the Best Women Development & Leadership Program in the Middle East at the Future Workplace Awards 2022, held in Dubai on 15 November, organized by the UK based Informa Connect, a member of the FTSE 100. Future Workplace Awards (formerly known as Middle East HR Excellence Awards) showcases the best human resources (HR) talent in the Middle East and honors HR professionals in government and the private sector for their outstanding contributions in creating a high performing workforce for the future.

WE STEM is a community of an internal pool of experts working towards supporting tech competitions, mentorships, and development programs. The WE STEM team is upskilled through individual development tracks as well as hands on experience and cross organizational collaboration. Participating in datathons, hackathons, and other tech related projects, the WE STEM members thrive on empowering other women to succeed in their fields of technology.

The most recent WE Hackathon was held at Zain Jordan's offices in March 2024 celebration of International Women's Day! The Hackathon brought together a talented group of Zainers from across our operations to leverage AI and develop innovative solutions that advance our DEI strategy within the evolving future of work.

The ideas presented were centered on reducing bias in position ranking and simplifying recruitment processes to empower the workforce. We are excited about the potential of these solutions to create a more inclusive and empowered future for all. Congratulations to all the winners!

WE COACH is a coaching program established through running psychometric profiling for high potentials from Zain’s organization and receiving coaching from a certified practitioner. The program revolves around each individual’s needs relating to working within teams and corporations, with each meeting dissecting the report and focusing on the participant’s challenges and opportunities for growth. The coaching sessions are structured to yield a multitude of personal outcomes, such as enhancing self-awareness, fostering accelerated team building through effective communication and collaboration strategies, unlocking greater leadership potential through targeted skill development and feedback mechanisms, nurturing meaningful relationships by fostering trust and empathy, and facilitating continuous professional growth through tailored development plans and actionable insights.

![WE_SUPPORT_2.png](https://d27ne1peune2h7.cloudfront.net/media/images/WE_SUPPORT_2.original.webp)

The WE SUPPORT Program identified and developed 14 high-potential employees aligned with Zain's 4SIGHT Strategy. In the first month, the focus was on Growth Verticals, including sessions on FinTech, InsurTech, and Esports. The second month emphasized Zain's digital transformation journey, with sessions on agility, innovation, and data insights. The third month aimed to raise awareness of ICT solutions, showcasing Zain's offerings. As a result, the team generated 6 ideas aligned with the 4SIGHT Strategy, presented them to Zain's leadership.

![WE_SUCCEED.jpg](https://d27ne1peune2h7.cloudfront.net/media/images/WE_SUCCEED.original.webp)

WE SUCCEED, an 8-month exceptional developmental journey purely catered to our valued Middle Management employees. This program is built on years of McKinsey research into “adaptability”, the skillset that allows people to learn, grow and thrive even under difficult, changing and uncertain conditions.

**ZY 2024**

ZY has relaunched with a new vision built by the youth for the youth. This strategy is built to help prepare our youth for the future of work and enable them to make a significant positive impact across our organization. The first phase of ZY was redefining the scope to include all employees aged up to 30. This has brought us in line with most classifications around the world and ensured that we have a way to track our progress against other global organizations.

## Introduction

### WE ABLE, Zain’s disability inclusion initiative, launched in 2019 in aims of making Zain disability inclusive by the year 2025. WE ABLE has four targets to ensure disability inclusion across all of Zain’s operations:

•    Zain will increase the employment of people with disabilities across its operations.

•    Zain will ensure all training programs are disability inclusive.

•    it will ensure all Zain operating locations are accessible.

•    Zain’s WE ABLE will identify and implement assistive technologies that will enable employees with disabilities to independently complete their tasks.

Zain has partnered with the ILO Global Business and Disability Network in October 2019 to help achieve these disability inclusion goals. Moreover, In July 2020 and through a global pandemic, Zain became a member of the Valuable 500, a global collective of CEOs who aim to place disability on the leadership agenda, proving Zain’s strategic goals will not be stopped. By joining the Valuable 500, Zain makes disability inclusion a priority.

In the words of the Vice Chairman and Group CEO Bader Nasser AlKharafi: “It is our duty to ensure WE are a diverse and inclusive workplace. Now is the time.”

BE WELL is Zain’s employee mental health and wellness program, established in 2021 to foster a culture of wellbeing across all Zain operations. Anchored by our Four M’s, Mental Health, Movement, Mindfulness, and Me, BE WELL promotes holistic wellness and creates a supportive, inclusive, and thriving workplace where our people feel psychologically safe. This program reflects our commitment to employee wellbeing and drives our Zain purpose of “Better Lives, Lasting Connections.”

![Zain Jordan employees practicing a mindfulness technique](https://d27ne1peune2h7.cloudfront.net/media/images/AWARENESS1.original.webp)

Our mindfulness initiatives equip employees with tools to manage stress, enhance focus, and build resilience. Collaborations with experts and platforms like Tuhoon provide webinars, workshops, and awareness campaigns. Key focus areas include work-life balance, stress management, and emotional intelligence, ensuring employees have practical resources to thrive.

![MHFAs at Zain](https://d27ne1peune2h7.cloudfront.net/media/images/MHFA_Group.original.webp)

Zain prioritizes mental health through comprehensive support systems. Highlights include partnerships with the Kuwait Counseling Center (KCC), which offers free counseling services to employees. Also, certified Mental Health First Aiders across our operations provide peer support, fostering a culture of understanding.

![Wellbeing Committee and Index Banner](https://d27ne1peune2h7.cloudfront.net/media/images/portrait.original.webp)

To cultivate a thriving culture of wellness and reinforce our leadership in employee mental health and wellbeing, we have established a dedicated Wellbeing Committee across all Zain operations, comprised of passionate Zainers committed to advancing mental health in our region. This committee is tasked with implementing the Mental Health at Work 'Wellbeing' Index (by One Mind), in collaboration with Omantel.

The Wellbeing Index, an externally researched and benchmarked tool, provides a comprehensive understanding of our current wellbeing ecosystem across Zain, highlighting strengths, areas for improvement, and priority actions. By leveraging these insights, we ensure our BE WELL strategy is data-driven, tailored to our people’s needs, and focused on holistic and meaningful wellbeing initiatives that go deeper than the surface and catalyze change that is embedded into the culture of Zain.

The committee will translate the findings of the index into actionable initiatives, working cross-functionally across departments to drive impactful and sustainable change, reinforcing our commitment to employee wellness at every level.

![Zain Bahrain Walkathon](https://d27ne1peune2h7.cloudfront.net/media/images/MOVEMENT9.original.webp)

Through initiatives like the BE WELL Distance Challenge, Ramadan Steps Challenge, and the Wellbeing Marathon, Zain promotes active lifestyles and strengthens camaraderie. Tailored activities, such as yoga, weight management challenges, and groupwide Global Wellness Day events, ensure engagement and holistic health across all Zain operations.
